find the bad version. I think this is something sorting-related
thought process
  1. we check the index at n/2
  	a. if that version is bad. then that means it is in the left half
  	b. if that version is good, then we go to the right half
  2.1 if n/2 is bad, check n/2/2
  2.2 if n/2 is good, check n/2/2 + n/2

not sure how to write this in code tho

(searched it up, this is a binary search)
