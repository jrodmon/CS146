given two nodes, find the parent node which is closest to both the two leaf nodes

we are given two nodes p and q

                      4
                  /      \
                3         8
              /        /      \
            1         5        9

input p = 3, q = 1
3 < 4 left 
  3==3 found
1 < 4 left
1 < 3 left (node q)
  1==1 found
if one of the nodes is a parent of the other, then the LCA is the parent

input p=1, q=5

lets traverse through the tree and look for patterns
search for p (1):
1 < 4
1 < 3
root -> left -> left
search for q (5):
5 > 4
5 < 8
root -> right -> left

if the root is greater than both p and q, make the new root the right child
if the root is less than p and q, new root = left child
if one leaf is greater and one leaf is less than root, that means the root splits apart and is therefore the LCA 
  repeat this using recursion
