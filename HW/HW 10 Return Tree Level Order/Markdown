                 .4.
           .3          .8.
         1           5     9
output: [[4],[3,8],[1,5,9]]

start with root (this is always 1)
root.left
root.right
for the children

root.left.left
....
root.right.right
for grandchildren
"can i keep track of how many .left or .rights are used?"
[after looking back at the slides, this is just BFS]
we start at root node
1. visit starting node. Mark as visited
2. discover the connected nodes and add them to the queue
3. while the queue is not empty dequeue the next element and add the connected nodes to the queue
Repeat until reaching the end

we need a visited array and a queue data structure
