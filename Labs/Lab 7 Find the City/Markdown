Floyd Warshalls
fill out a matrix	 compare each value to distanceThreshold

The basic idea that i recall from lecture is this:
    is it shorter to travel from i to k to j 
    than it is to travel from just i to j
    where k is going to be acting as the intermediate vertex 


1.  Create distance matrix

2.  Fill distance matrix with the edges

3.  Floyd Warshalls algorithm
    for (k=1; k <= n; k++)
        for (i=1; 9 <=n; i++) 
            for (j=1; k<=n; j++)
                A[i,j] = min(A[i,j], A[i,k] + A[k,j])
    Using k as the intermediate node, we make comparisons between the edges of i and j to the sum of the edges of i,k and k,j

4.  Count the reachable cities from each city
