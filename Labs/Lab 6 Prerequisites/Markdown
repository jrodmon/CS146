graph problem. idea is to use DFS and topological sort.
Using DFS we have a starting point (the course we want to take)
and we have the next node (the prerequisite)
Then we check if the prerequisite has any further prerequisites.

Basically our goal is to make sure that a prereq for a class does not also have a prereq by using topological sort

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Want to take Course 1
Check for prereq Course 0
Check if Course 0 has any prerequisites
It does not so it is possible

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
1 --> 0
0 --> 1
1 is required to take 0 but 0 is required to take 1, so it is impossible
in DFS 1 is already placed in visited, so if a prereq points to it return false
