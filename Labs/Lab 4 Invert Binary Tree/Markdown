Start with a binary tree
hint: use recursion.
We run a recursive function to the last leaf nodes

                    1
              /           \
            2              8
          /   \          /   \
        3      4        5     6

lets just look at a subtree and go from there
            2
          /   \
        3      4

root = 2
root.left = 3
root.right = 4
  WE WANT
root = 2

temp = root.left
root.right = root.left
root.left = temp
NOW node2 should be linked to nodes 4and3 regardless of where node 2 goes.
then repeat this for all nodes
(also if it is a leaf node, then its children will be null)
